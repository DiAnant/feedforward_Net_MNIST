# feedforward_neural_network_MSE
This is a neural network made from scratch using python numpy to classify the MNIST images.

This network uses a Mean Square Error Cost Function and normal weight initialization. A better neural network with all the desired changes will be uploaded on another repository.


The code for the neural network is taken from Michael Nielsen's excellent deep learning book at neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com

All the credit goes to him.
